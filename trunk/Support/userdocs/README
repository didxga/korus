			   Korus _RELEASE_

			 ===================

Korus is a pure Java based Actor Pattern. Unlike Java it emphasizes on minimum 
use of threads to execute tasks in parallel. Threads are heavy in nature, thus 
context switching becomes an expensive operation. Korus Style of concurrency 
uses processes instead which are very light-weight and easy to create. These 
processes are asynchronous in nature and communicate each other with the help 
of Messages.


Why use Korus?
--------------

Korus is also equipped with java library of parallel programming constructs 
aimed to ease the task of writing concurrent java applications for the

constructs along with a few basic constructs. We are releasing it to the 
open source world in the hope that it will prove to be a platform for many 
more parallel constructs.
