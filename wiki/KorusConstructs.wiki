==ParallelFor ==
ParallelFor is a parallel version of a for loop which executes the loop parallely and tries to utilize more number of cores for lower turnaround time. A ParallelFor loop takes in a range which determines the number of times the for loop needs to run and the grainsize (which determines the number of threads Korus will allocate).

A Sample example of using Korus ParallelFor Construct can be found [http://code.google.com/p/korus/wiki/ParallelFor HERE]


== Pipeline==
Pipeline allows you to model your sequential independent task parallely. For example, a file transformation job can be modeled as 3 tasks of reading, transforming and writing the file. The tasks communicate to each other via one-way intermediate queues.
