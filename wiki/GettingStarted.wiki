This page provides you a step-by-step to get started with korus

= 1. Getting Korus =

== 1.1 Binary Edition ==

The latest stable version of Korus is available from the Korus web page http://code.google.com/p/korus/source/checkout 

You can then either put the JARs of Korus to your preferred directory or put the jars on the system classpath. 

For the current version of Korus, you will also need a JDK installed on your system, version 1.5 or later required, 1.5 or later strongly recommended. 

== 1.2 Source Edition ==

If you prefer the source edition, you can download the source for the latest Korus release from http://code.google.com/p/korus/source/checkout. You can access the code using SVN. The Korus website has details on accessing SVN. 

See the section Building Korus on how to build Korus from the source code.

The binary distribution of  consists of the following directory layout:
{{{
  Korus
   +--- README, LICENSE, other text files. //basic information
   +--- bin  // contains launcher scripts
   |
   +--- lib  // contains jars plus necessary dependencies
   |
   +--- docs // contains documentation
   |      |
   |      +--- images  // various logos for html documentation
   |      |
   |      +--- manual  // Documentation (a must read ;-)
   |
   +--- etc 
}}}

== 1.3 Checkout Korus ==
Use an SVN client 
{{{
  $ svn checkout http://korus.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ korus-read-only
}}}

== 1.4 Building Korus==
{{{
 $ cd build
 $ ./ant.sh clean
 $ ./ant.sh recompile
 $ ./ant.sh jar
}}}

== 2.1 Parallel For Concepts ==

=== 2.1.1 BlockedRange ===

It is a single unit of block that can be executed in a single iteration. Suppose, we have an iteration space from 0 to n. Then, an object of blocked range will be constructed whose first argument will be the start of the iteration and second argument will be end of the iteration. A third argument _ grainSize _ will also have to be specified which breaks these _ BlockedRanges _ into units which can be executed by a single core or processor.
{{{
BlockedRange range= new BlockedRange(1,10000,1250);
}}}

will finally construct  10000/1250 = 8 _ BlockedRanges _

=== 2.1.2 GrainSize ===

The _grainSize_ enables you to decide the degree of parallelization you want achieve while running your program. It helps in dividing the task into subranges. Every subrange has some cost associated to it. A smaller _grainsize_ may also result in excessive overhead and may hinder useful work. So, the size of the _grainsize_ has to be chosen very carefully. 

=== 2.1.3 ParallelTask ===
In order to write a parallel function in a class, it has to extend a _ ParallelTask _. A _ ParallelTask _ bounds the user to implement a _service()_ and a _summarize()_ method. The code written inside the for block of a serial function comes in the for block of the _service()_ method. A _summarize()_ block is written in order to summarize all the intermediate results. 

A sample implementation of ParallelFor can be found [http://code.google.com/p/korus/wiki/ParallelFor here].

== 2.2 Pipeline Concepts==

=== 2.2.1 Pipeline ===
The term pipeline refers to the fact that each step is carrying data at once (like water), and each step is connected to the next (like the links of a pipe.)

- Wikipedia

The idea of a pipeline is to split the processing of data into number of steps. Each of these steps will run independently, process data and put the data in its _ outputQueue _. The _ outputQueue _ of the first step will be the _ inputQueue _ for the consecutive step. The first step will have no _ inputQueue _ and the last step will have no _ outputQueue _. 

=== 2.2.2 PipelineTask  ===

In order to implement pipeline, stages or pipeline tasks need to be written. These tasks are written by extending a _ PipelineTask _ and overriding its _ service() _ method.

These tasks are then added to the pipeline, paired (in order to decide the order of tasks) and executed. A pipeline task just has a _ service() _ method and no _ summarize() _ method. 

A sample implementation of a _ Pipeline _ can be found [http://code.google.com/p/korus/wiki/Pipeline here].
