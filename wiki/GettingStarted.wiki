== OS Platform ==

Korus is Tested on Windows XP and Linux Platforms. Since, it is a purely java based framework it should run on all the platforms supporting java.

== Prerequisites ==
JDK 1.5 and above

== Getting Started Quickly ==
This is a quick start step. Helps to understand the very basic way to get a simple program running using Korus. You can also see how the code is organized and how to write a Korus enabled program. You can easily change the code and see how Korus works. The intent is to provide a first-step-instant-learning. It is good to start with this and then go to the details as mentioned below. Download Sample.zip from [http://korus.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Product/korus/example/Sample.zip HERE]
This will contain

  # korus.jar
  # BuyProcess1.java
  # BuyProcess2.java
  # TestProcess.java
  # sourcefiles
  # run.bat (Windows environment)
  # run.sh (linux/unix environment)

Execute the file _run.bat_ or _run.sh_ depending on your OS

== Getting Started in Detail ==
These are detailed set of instructions as well as internal aspects. It is recommended to go through this before writing "real" programs with Korus.

== 1. Getting Korus ==

To get the latest version of Korus do a regular svn checkout.
{{{
  $ svn checkout http://korus.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ <your_directory_name>
}}}

You will also need a JDK installed on your system, version 1.5 or later required. The svn trunk consists of the following directory layout:
{{{

   +--- Plan
   |
   +--- Product // contains API Files
   |      |
   |      +--- korus
   |              |
   |              +--- bin        // Compiled Code
   |              +--- build      // Build Scripts

=== 1.2 Install Ant ===

Install ant from [http://ant.apache.org/ here]


=== 1.3 Building Korus ===

==== 1.3.1 Windows ====

Go to the Product --> korus Folder

{{{
 > cd build
 > ant clean
 > ant compile
 > ant jar
}}}

This will generate the jar in your Product --> korus --> jar Folder. You can then either put the JAR of Korus to your preferred directory or put the jars on the system CLASSPATH. 

If you prefer to the source edition, you can find it in the Product --> korus --> src Folder. 

For only using the compiled classes you need to :

{{{
 > cd build
 > ant clean
 > ant compile
}}}

This will compile the Java classes and into the Product --> korus --> bin Folder.

For compiling test classes.

{{{
 > cd build
 > ant test_compile
}}}

Compile it using the java compile commands and you can start using it in your Project.

Or else you can also use java command-line options
*Example:* java -classpath C:\korus0.1\Test\bin;C:\korus0\Product\korus\jar\korus.jar com.impetus.labs.korus.test.pipeline.PipelineTest

==== 1.3.2 Unix ====

Go to the Product --> korus Folder

{{{
 $ cd build
 $ ./ant.sh clean
 $ ./ant.sh compile
 $ ./ant.sh jar
}}}

This will generate the jar in your Product --> korus --> jar Folder. You can then either put the JAR of Korus to your preferred directory or put the jars on the system CLASSPATH. 

If you prefer to the source edition, you can find it in the Product --> korus --> src Folder. 

For only using the compiled classes you need to :

{{{
 $ cd build
 $ ./ant.sh clean
 $ ./ant.sh compile
}}}

This will compile the Java classes and into the Product --> korus --> bin Folder.

For compiling test classes.

{{{
 > cd build
 > ./ant.sh test_compile
}}}

Compile it using the java compile commands and you can start using it in your Project.

Or else you can also use java command-line options
*Example:* java -cp '/home/user/svn_repo/korus0.1/Test/bin:/home/user/svn_repo/korus0.1/Product/korus/jar/korus.jar' com.impetus.labs.korus.test.pipeline.PipelineTest

== 2. Configuring Korus ==

*Step 1.* Set the enviorment variable KORUS_HOME pointing to the Korus installation directory. 
Example: KORUS_HOME=Product/korus

*Step 2. (Optional)* In the KORUS_HOME/properties edit the config file korus.properties. Change the properties to fine tune the Korus runtime as per the system configuration

*If the properties file is not configured Korus runs with default properties.*

== 3. Using Korus ==
This section explains various ways in which the Korus framework can be used. All of them are explained by means of examples.

  # *Korus core API's*
     Details can be found [http://code.google.com/p/korus/wiki/AsynchronousDistributedProgrammingMode here]<br/>
  # *Parallel programming constructs.*<br/>
    * `parallel_for` : A parallel version of a for loop, more details can be found [http://code.google.com/p/korus/wiki/ParallelFor here]<br/>
    * `pipeline` : It allows you to model your sequential independent task in parallel, more details can be found [http://code.google.com/p/korus/wiki/Pipeline here]<br/><br/>
