==2. Parallelized Text Transformer Program==

This involved writing an application which reads a Text file, transforms and writes it into another file. A serial as well as a parallel version were written. The parallel version utilized 3 cores for each of the reading, transforming and writing tasks. The parallel version was written using octopus.
