#summary Describes the Best Practices and Guidelines for Korus

=== Guidelines and Best Practices ===

1. Problem definition must be Breakable i.e. big enough to break it into small Processes.

2. Processes should not be too big in execution otherwise it would end up being a sequential program.

3. Avoid too small Processes. Ideally execution time of a Process should be more than execution time taken by Korus Runtime to manage a process.

4. Run independent Processes of a use case in Parallel.

5. For CPU Intensive Processes adjust Number of Executers in properties file to optimize performance.

6. Number of Schedulers can also be adjusted depending upon the amount of message or request in Korus Runtime.

7. Do not write blocking code in Processes.

8. Send small messages in Remote Process Call.
